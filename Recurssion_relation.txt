1  Find the val%e of T(2) for the rec%rrence relation T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n, given that T(0)=5.

T(n)=3T(n−1)+12n, with an initial condition 

T(0)=5.

Let's find 

T(2) using the given recurrence relation:


T(n)=3T(n−1)+12n

First, find 

T(1):

T(1)=3T(0)+12(1)

T(1)=3(5)+12

T(1)=15+12

T(1)=27

Now, find 

T(2):


T(2)=3T(1)+12(2)


T(2)=3(27)+24

T(2)=81+24

105
T(2)=105

So, the value of 

T(2) for the given recurrence relation and initial condition is 105.

2 Given a rec%rrence relation, solve it %sing the s%bstit%tion method:
a. T(n) = T(n-1) + c
b. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
c. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + c
d. T(n) = T(n/2) + c

Sure, let's solve each recurrence relation using the substitution method:


a. T(n)=T(n−1)+c

So, the solution to the recurrence relation is 

T(n)=T(0)+nc.

b. T(n)=2T(n/2)+n

 the solution is 

T(n)=O(nlogn).

c. T(n)=2T(n/2)+c

the solution is T(n)=O(n)

d. T(n)=T(n/2)+c

the solution is T(n)=O(logn).

3. Given a rec%rrence relation, solve it %sing the rec%rsive tree approach:
a. T(n) = 2T(n-1) +1
b. T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n

Certainly! Let's solve each recurrence relation using the recursive tree approach:

a. T(n) &= 2T(n-1) + 1 \\
&= 2[2T(n-2) + 1] + 1 \\
&= 2^2 T(n-2) + 2 + 1 \\
&= 2^3 T(n-3) + 2^2 + 2 + 1 \\
&= \ldots
\end{align*} \]
The pattern suggests that the solution is \(T(n) = 2^n T(0) + 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \ldots + 2^1 + 2^0\).

b. . \(T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n\)
The recursive tree for this recurrence relation looks like a binary tree, where each node has two children:
```
T(n)
/ \
T(n/2) T(n/2)
/ \ / \
... ... ... ...
```
At each level, the cost is \(n\), and the tree has \(\log_2 n\) levels.
The total cost is the sum of the costs at each level. The cost at level \(i\) is \(2^i \cdot \frac{n}{2^i} = n\).
So, the total cost is \(n \log_2 n\).
Therefore, the solution is \(T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)\).
