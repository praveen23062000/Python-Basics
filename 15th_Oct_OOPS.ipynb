    "\n",
    "# In Python, access modifiers (e.g., private, protected) are more of a convention than a strict enforcement. Developers can still access private attributes if they really want to, as Python does not provide true access control like some other languages.\n",
    "# Complexity of Attribute Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "# To prevent naming conflicts and to indicate that an attribute is meant to be private, a name mangling convention (e.g., _attribute or __attribute) is often used. This can make attribute names longer and less readable.\n",
