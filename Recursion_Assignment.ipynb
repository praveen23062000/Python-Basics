    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tower_of_hanoi function takes four parameters: n (the number of disks), source_rod (the rod from which disks should be moved), target_rod (the rod to which disks should be moved), and auxiliary_rod (the auxiliary rod).\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case of the recursion is when n is 1, in which case it simply prints the move to transfer the single disk from the source rod to the target rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recursive case (when n is greater than 1), the function first recursively moves n-1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod using the target rod as the temporary rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then prints the move to transfer the remaining disk from the source rod to the target rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it recursively moves the n-1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the target rod using the source rod as the temporary rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movements of disks between rods are accomplished through the recursive calls, and the algorithm ensures that the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi problem are adhered to, making it an elegant solution to the puzzle"
